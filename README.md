# Hotel Booking Form

This is a hotel booking form that allows the user to input their first and last names, select check-in and check-out dates, and select one of four hotel options. The prosivisional booking is displayed back to the user when they press submit button. The user's data is then saved to the hotel database when they press confirm. If a duplicate booking exists, the user is notified before they confirm their second booking.
